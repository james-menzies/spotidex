## Entry-VM

The entry VM is the interface that the main perspective of the app interacts
with. Every time the user refreshes, this class is responsible for making sure 
all the data is there.


Assume the user has logged in and hits 'begin session'. The Entry View is 
switched and provides the viewModel with the function to update the screen.
